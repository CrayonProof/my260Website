                        I order a photo from Gabbitas Photography every day just for the rush of adrenaline that accompanies it. I wish everyone could have one of these photos.

                        This was not the cherry slicer I ordered from Amazon. Instead of my long-anticipated cherry slicer, I recieved some photo of a rock in the water. I don't even know how this happened. I just want my cherry slicer.

                        All in all they are pretty flimsy. The front is plastic, not glass. But for the price you can’t beat them and once they’re on the wall they look great! They come with the mat & a hanging device too which is a plus! I got 20 for a gallery wall and I couldn’t be happier with the outcome. One frame front was scratch and the company was easy to contact and work with and offered to send me another frame hassle free.

                        Good bang for the buck. They’re not high end gallery frames/matte/glass. But, they are awesome for quickly matting, framing a photograph. The film on both sides of the plastic (not glass) takes a second to figure out how to remove, but afterwards removes easily. The frames are worth the price point, ship nicely in a box with little chance of damage in-transit to your house. Buy a few, or a few different sizes from this brand at these prices, you’ll finally frame those photographs you’ve been meaning to!

                        Decent looking frames that provide a simple and clean presentation. Everything about them is definitely light-weight (thin mat, thin plexiglas, thin back panel, and the actual frame is plastic). So, I wouldn't call these frames sturdy. However, for the low price and their simplicity, they work great for showing off prints and other art. I use them to present some of my 8x10" pen illustrations and watercolors. If a person wants to spend more money for a higher quality frame, that's up to them. In the meantime, they streamline my presentation process because I no longer have to deal with cutting mats and glass/plexiglas and assembling sectional frames.

                        They are definitely cheaper and light weight but once my photos were framed they looked just a nice as more expensive frames. The only issue I've had is that the matte around my photo is not perfectly white. Under the right circumstances you wouldn't notice but if you're framing a photo with a white boarder or something, it will be obvious.
