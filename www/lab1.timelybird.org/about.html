                <p> &emsp; Matthew Gabbitas was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on November 26, 1922, and grew up in Saint Paul. He was the only child of Carl Schulz and Dena Halverson, and was of German and Norwegian descent. His uncle called him "Sparky" after the horse Spark Plug in Billy DeBeck's comic strip, Barney Google, which Matthew enjoyed reading
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp; Matthew loves drawing and sometimes drew his family dog, Spike, who ate unusual things, such as pins and tacks. In 1937, Matthew drew a picture of Spike and sent it to Ripley's Believe It or Not!; his drawing appeared in Robert Ripley's syndicated panel, captioned, "A hunting dog that eats pins, tacks, and razor blades is owned by C. F. Schulz, St. Paul, Minn." and "Drawn by 'Sparky'" (C.F. was his father, Carl Fred Schulz).
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp; Matthew attended Richards Gordon Elementary School in Saint Paul, where he skipped two half-grades. He became a shy, timid teenager, perhaps as a result of being the youngest in his class at Central High School. One well-known episode in his high school life was the rejection of his drawings by his high school yearbook, which he referred to in Peanuts years later, when he had Lucy ask Charlie Brown to sign a picture he drew of a horse, only to then say it was a prank. A five-foot-tall statue of Snoopy was placed in the school's main office 60 years later.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp; Matthew's first group of regular cartoons, a weekly series of one-panel jokes called Li’l Folks, was published from June 1947 to January 1950 in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, with Matthew usually doing four one-panel drawings per issue. It was in Li'l Folks that Matthew first used the name Charlie Brown for a character, although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys as well as one buried in sand. The series also had a dog that looked much like Snoopy. In May 1948, Matthew sold his first one-panel drawing to The Saturday Evening Post; within the next two years, a total of 17 untitled drawings by Matthew were published in the Post, simultaneously with his work for the Pioneer Press. Around the same time, he tried to have Li'l Folks syndicated through the Newspaper Enterprise Association; Matthew would have been an independent contractor for the syndicate, unheard of in the 1940s, but the deal fell through. Li'l Folks was dropped from the Pioneer Press in January 1950.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp; Later that year, Matthew approached United Feature Syndicate with the one-panel series Li'l Folks, and the syndicate became interested. By that time Matthew had also developed a comic strip, usually using four panels rather than one, and to Matthew's delight, the syndicate preferred that version. But to his consternation, the syndicate had to change the title for Matthew's strip for legal reasons and selected a new name Peanuts.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp; Peanuts made its first appearance on October 2, 1950, in seven newspapers. The weekly Sunday page debuted on January 6, 1952. After a slow start, Peanuts eventually became one of the most popular comic strips of all time, as well as one of the most influential. Matthew also had a short-lived sports-oriented comic strip, It's Only a Game (1957–59), but he abandoned it after the success of Peanuts. From 1956 to 1965 he contributed a gag cartoon, Young Pillars, featuring teenagers, to Youth, a publication associated with the Church of God.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp; In 1957 and 1961 he illustrated two volumes of Art Linkletter's Kids Say the Darndest Things, and in 1964 a collection of letters, Dear President Johnson, by Bill Adler.
